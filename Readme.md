# Fireflies

## About

This is a simulation meant for testing decentralized phase and frequency synchronization algorithms for the [rudelblinken](https://github.com/zebreus/rudelblinken) project.

## Testing your own algorithm

The file `fireflies.py` contains the main simulation loop. The `fireflies` directory contains different implementations for the firefly class. See `fireflies/basic.py` for a simple example for creating your own firefly.
